Introduction

The usefulness of computers is partly a result of their versatility in
solving various problems and performing tasks. To be able to take
advantage of the speed and power of computers, one needs to know how
to program. This module is about computer programming and how it can
be used to solve problems or perform useful tasks.

Our language of choice is Python -- a recent language which has been
found to be powerful, relatively easy to learn, and able to provide a
platform to advanced programming. In this module you will learn how to
analyse a problem and develop an effective solution for it using the
Python programming language.

What is a computer?
===================

A computer is a general-purpose device which behaves according to the
sets of instructions and data with which it is provided.  Computers
execute instructions to process data.  Each computer has at its core a
central processing unit (CPU) -- modern CPUs are built as a single
microprocessor chip.
