Useful libraries

Python comes with a built-in selection of modules which provide commonly used functionality.  We have encountered some of these modules in previous chapters -- for example, ``itertools``, ``logging``, ``pdb`` and ``unittest``.  We will look at a few more examples in this chapter.  You can see the full list of available modules, and find out more details about each one, by reading the `Python Standard Library documentation <http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/index.html>`_.

* datetime
* math
* random
* re
* csv parsing
* sys and argparse -- scripts and command-line parameters
* os? simple system-agnostic functionality
* sqlite? xml parsing? Something to do with the web? Put all this in one section?
