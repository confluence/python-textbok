This book was originally written to serve as course notes for an MSc-level 
course in IT at the University of Cape Town. Several chapters are translated 
from an earlier set of Java notes. While the focus and content of this book may 
change in the future, the 1.0 branch will preserve it as it is now, except for 
factual corrections.
